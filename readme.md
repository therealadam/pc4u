# Prince Cooks 4 U

A single-serving site at the crossroads of Prince fandom, dad jokes, and building a human-scale web.

## Small is fine, boring is fine

Principles:
- build more like a craft-person than an industrialist
- get the idea out there, not the technology
- finished is better than interesting

## Build and release

To your personal computer:
1. Make changes to source files
2. `rake dev` will rebuild and open the generated `index.html` file

To the web:
1. `rake release`
2. That's it
